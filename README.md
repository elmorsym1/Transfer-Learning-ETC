# Enhancing Effective Thermal Conductivity Predictions in Digital Porous Media Using Transfer Learning

**Data:**

The data includes sub-volumes of the following rocks,
  - Bentheimer Sandstone 
  - Ketton Limestone
  - Berea Sandstone

The raw CT rock cores are obtained from the [Imperial Colloge London portal](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/research/research-groups/pore-scale-modelling/micro-ct-images-and-networks/).

The sub-volumes are simulated for Effective Thermal Conductivity using OpenFOAM and their results are summerized in the provided excel sheet having the following information,

 - Number of sub-samples = XXX
 - Labels description:
    - casename = sub-sampling index per rock type sample
    - porosity = ratio of void fraction
    - eff_porosity = the connected porosity
    - rock_type = 
                   
                   {
                   
                   1:Bentheimer Sandstone,
                   
                   2:Ketton Limestone,
                   
                   3:Berea Sandstone,
                   
                   }
                   
    - k = Effective Thermal Conductivity
